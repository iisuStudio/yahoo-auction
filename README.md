# Yahoo Auction Http library

This library can bid on lot, watch bidding list, get won auction from yahoo auction like a browser. Parse auction pages and get you information about lots.
This library use Yahoo auction API just for get information of a lot. Other requests execute like a normal browser.
Of course it is no good like real API but working for me and maybe help you in your project.
